It enables significant improvements to image captioning and groundbreaking customization capabilities with few-shot learning. Until today, model customization has required large datasets with hundreds of images per label to achieve production quality for vision tasks. Now Cognitive Services for Vision is capable of recognizing millions of object categories out-of-the-box, which makes features like captions rich with details and sematic understanding. Custom models can achieve high quality when trained with just a few images, lowering the bar for creating computer vison models that support challenging use cases. \n\n",status:a,created_on:"2023-03-16T19:48:27.010Z",reference:"https:\u002F\u002Fazure.microsoft.com\u002Fupdates\u002Fpublic-preview-azure-cognitive-service-for-vision-powers-stateoftheart-computer-vision-development\u002F",more_info:"https:\u002F\u002Fazure.microsoft.com\u002Fproducts\u002Fcognitive-services\u002Fvision-services",posted_date:"2023-03-14",product:[{sku_id:{sku_name:"Cognitive Services"}}]},{id:7046,description:"You can now use the Azure Database for MySQL - Flexible Server connector when building applications using Power Apps and workflows using Azure Logic apps.
